However, the insult is directed at her as an individual and political figure, not based on any protected characteristic. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: 'Crooked Hillary' is a pejorative nickname, but not based on protected characteristics.\n\n2. Calls for Violence: The post does not incite or encourage physical harm or violence against any individual or group. It references 'due process,' which is a legal principle, and does not contain any language suggesting violence. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: 'deserves “due process”' is a call for legal procedure, not violence.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The post uses the term 'Crooked Hillary,' which is a derogatory nickname, but it does not contain profanity, slurs, or offensive language targeting protected groups. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: 'Crooked' is an insult, but not a slur or profanity, and not directed at a protected group.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Edge Case 1 applies: The post targets a public figure (Hillary Clinton) without explicit calls for violence or slurs targeting protected groups. Therefore, classify as 0 (no hate speech).",

The laughter ('make me lafff... und laff.. und laff...') further indicates ridicule. This satisfies the criterion for demeaning or degrading individuals or groups based on protected characteristics (ethnicity/religion).\n\n2. Calls for Violence: There is no explicit incitement or encouragement of physical harm or violence in the post. Not satisfied. No text evidence of calls for violence.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The post uses coded language ('JQ', 'Goys') that is commonly associated with hate speech, particularly in antisemitic contexts. While not overtly profane, the use of these terms in this context is offensive and derogatory toward protected groups. Satisfied.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Edge case 6: The post uses ambiguous/coded references ('JQ', 'Goys'), but in this case, the context and combination of terms ('race', 'redpilled', 'JQ', 'Goys') and the mocking tone provide sufficient evidence of demeaning language targeting protected groups. Therefore, this is not merely ambiguous/coded language without context; it is explicit enough to satisfy the hate speech criteria.\n- Edge case 7: The post dehumanizes or trivializes protected groups (Jewish people and non-Jews) through mocking and coded hate speech. Satisfied.",

The phrase 'mass arrest the NGO boat owners' is a call for legal action, not violence.

There is no explicit or implicit demeaning language toward a protected group. Not satisfied. Evidence: '17 of MS-13’s Leadership Taken Down in Massive Crackdown by DEA.'\n\n2. Calls for Violence: The post does not incite or encourage violence against any individual or group. It reports on law enforcement action. Not satisfied. Evidence: No language encouraging violence, only reporting arrests.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The post does not contain profanity, slurs, or offensive language. Not satisfied. Evidence: No vulgar or offensive terms present.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Edge Case 1: The post targets a criminal organization (MS-13), which is not a protected group, and does not use slurs or call for violence against a protected group. This matches edge case 1: 'when the post targets non-protected groups, individuals, or characteristics (e.g., political groups, institutions, public figures) without explicit calls for violence or slurs targeting protected groups -> classify as 0 (no hate speech)'.\n- Edge Case 5: The post contains a URL, but the text itself is sufficient for evaluation, so this does not apply.\n\nNo other edge case applies. There is no ambiguity or coded language, and the post is straightforward in reporting a news event.",

There is no language in the post that calls for, incites, or encourages violence. Not satisfied.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The guideline asks if the post contains profanity, slurs, or other offensive language that may or may not be directed at individuals or groups. The post uses enthusiastic language ('EPIC!', 'OUTSTANDING'), but no profanity, slurs, or offensive language. Not satisfied.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- The post references a public figure (Katie Hopkins) and a country (the UK), but does not target protected groups or use hate speech elements. This matches edge case 1: 'when the post targets non-protected groups, individuals, or characteristics (e.g., political groups, institutions, public figures) without explicit calls for violence or slurs targeting protected groups -> classify as 0 (no hate speech)'.\n- There is no ambiguous or coded language, nor is there insufficient information for evaluation.\n\nConclusion: None of the hate speech criteria are satisfied, and the post fits an existing edge case.",

The post uses the phrase 'traitor son of a bitches,' which is vulgar and demeaning, but it is not explicitly directed at a protected group; rather, it targets 'traitors,' which is not a protected characteristic. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. \n\n2. Calls for Violence: The post says 'Throw every one ... off the bench and hang them RFN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' This is a clear incitement to violence against the targeted group ('traitors'), but again, 'traitors' is not a protected group. Therefore, while the post contains a call for violence, it is not directed at a protected group as defined by the guideline. This criterion is NOT satisfied for hate speech under the guideline. \n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The post uses the phrase 'son of a bitches,' which is vulgar and offensive language. However, the guideline specifies that this is relevant to hate speech only if it is directed at protected groups or individuals based on protected characteristics. Here, the vulgarity is directed at 'traitors,' not a protected group. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied for hate speech under the guideline. \n\nEdge Case Handling: According to edge case 1, when the post targets non-protected groups, individuals, or characteristics (e.g., political groups, institutions, public figures) without explicit calls for violence or slurs targeting protected groups -> classify as 0 (no hate speech). In this case, 'traitors' is a non-protected group, and while there is a call for violence, it is not against a protected group. Therefore, edge case 1 applies.",

Evidence: The post is focused on positive encouragement and support for a content creator.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The guideline asks if the post contains profanity, slurs, or other offensive language. There is no vulgar, profane, or offensive language present. Evidence: The language is neutral and supportive.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Edge Case 2: The post references 'Western women,' which could be interpreted as a reference to a protected group (women, possibly with a regional/cultural qualifier), but there is no explicit assault on dignity, call for violence, or offensive language directed at them. The reference is positive/supportive, not demeaning.\n- Edge Case 4: The post could be seen as implicitly valorizing a particular group (Western women), but there is no explicit antagonism, demeaning language, or offensive targeting of any protected group.\n- No ambiguous/coded language, insufficient information, or reporting of offensive material is present.\n\nConclusion: The post does not satisfy any of the criteria for hate speech as defined in the guidelines.",

Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The post does not contain profanity, slurs, or other offensive language. Not satisfied. \n\nEdge Case Handling: \n- The post references protected groups (race, gender) but lacks explicit assaults on dignity, calls for violence, or vulgar/offensive language directed at them (Edge Case 2). \n- There is some implicit antagonism or ambiguous framing (e.g., referencing 'Superior' on a shirt, mentioning Wolfgang Willrich), but there is no explicit demeaning language, call for violence, or offensive targeting (Edge Case 4). \n- The post may be interpreted as making a subtle or coded reference to racial superiority (via the 'Superior' shirt and the Willrich reference), but it lacks explicit demeaning language or calls for violence (Edge Case 6). \n- No dehumanization or trivialization of atrocities is present (Edge Case 7). \n- No reporting of offensive material or insensitivity without direct targeting (Edge Case 8). \n- There is some ambiguity and potential for coded language, but no explicit evidence of hate speech (Edge Case 9).",

In many contexts, 'monkey' is a well-known racial slur used to demean Black people.

This satisfies the criterion for demeaning or degrading individuals or groups based on race (protected characteristic).

Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The phrase contains explicit vulgarity and offensive language directed at women. 4. Edge Case Handling: The post targets a protected group (women) with explicit vulgar and demeaning language, thus does not fall under any edge case for non-hate speech. The presence of a URL does not obscure the clear hate speech content in the text.",

The guideline's edge case 1 states that targeting non-protected groups (e.g., political groups) without explicit calls for violence or slurs targeting protected groups should be classified as 0 (no hate speech). Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied in the sense of hate speech as defined by the guideline, though the language is offensive. Evidence: 'libtards'.\n\nEdge Case Handling: Edge case 1 applies: 'when the post targets non-protected groups, individuals, or characteristics (e.g., political groups, institutions, public figures) without explicit calls for violence or slurs targeting protected groups -> classify as 0 (no hate speech)'. The post targets political groups with offensive language but does not target protected characteristics as defined by the guideline.",
