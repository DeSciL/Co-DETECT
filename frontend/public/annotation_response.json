The post compares 'Democrat' (a political group) and 'radical Muslim' (a religious and potentially ethnic group) and asserts that both display 'hatred' equally, with the 'only difference' being 'attire.' This degrades both groups by equating them with hatred and, in the case of 'radical Muslim,' invokes a negative stereotype associated with Muslims. The phrase 'the only difference between the two is attire' further dehumanizes by reducing complex identities to a superficial difference and shared negative trait. \n\n2.

Assaults on Human Dignity: \n- Checking for demeaning or degrading language based on protected characteristics. \n- Evidence: The post refers to 'dangerous infidelophobic Muslim refugees', which degrades a group based on religion and ethnicity, using 'dangerous' and 'infidelophobic' as pejoratives. The phrase 'the Pope covers up systemic pedophilia inside the Catholic Church' is a strong accusation but targets an institution/individual rather than a protected group, unless interpreted as anti-Catholic. 'The EU are corrupt dictators' is a political insult, not a protected characteristic. The use of 'retard' for Bono and U2 is an ableist slur, demeaning individuals based on (implied) intellectual disability. \n- Satisfied: Yes, multiple instances (ableist slur, anti-Muslim rhetoric).\n\n2.

This language targets an individual (Valerie Jarrett, a public figure who is a Black woman) and uses animalistic and reptilian terms, which have historically been used as racial slurs and to demean people of color. The phrase 'these people are right out of HELL' further dehumanizes the group associated with Jarrett. Evidence: 'Reptile Ape Valerie Jarrett', 'these people are right out of HELL.'\n\n2.

The term 'ILLEGAL ALIENS' is a dehumanizing and derogatory term for undocumented immigrants, targeting a group based on immigration status (which is often closely tied to ethnicity/race in US discourse). The phrase 'Go figure he'd employ ILLEGAL ALIENS' implies a negative stereotype about both the employer and the group of workers. This satisfies the criterion for demeaning/degrading a group based on protected characteristics (ethnicity/national origin).\n\n2.

Assaults on Human Dignity: The guideline asks if the post demeans or degrades individuals or groups based on protected characteristics such as race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, etc. In this post, 'Bill & Hillary' refers to specific individuals (Bill and Hillary Clinton), but there is no reference to any protected characteristic. The post accuses them of being 'the Gold Standard for crime in Arkansas,' which is a strong negative statement, but it is not based on any protected characteristic. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: 'Bill & Hillary are still the Gold Standard for crime in Arkansas...' is a personal attack, not a group/protected characteristic attack.\n\n2. Calls for Violence: The guideline asks if the post incites or encourages physical harm or violence against individuals or groups. There is no language in the post that calls for, incites, or encourages violence. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: No mention of violence or harm.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The guideline asks if the post contains profanity, slurs, or other offensive language. The phrase 'Gold Standard for crime' is a strong accusation but does not contain profanity, slurs, or language that is generally considered vulgar or offensive in itself. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: No profanity or slurs present.",

The post criticizes CNN and its viewership but does not target any protected group or individual based on protected characteristics. Evidence: The only group mentioned is 'CNN' (a media company) and its viewers, not a protected class.\n\n2. Calls for Violence:\n- Checked for incitement or encouragement of physical harm or violence against individuals or groups.\n- Not satisfied. There is no language inciting or encouraging violence. Evidence: The post only discusses viewership statistics and makes a sarcastic comment about CNN's popularity.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language:\n- Checked for profanity, slurs, or other offensive language, whether or not directed at individuals or groups.\n- Not satisfied. The post uses sarcasm ('#VeryFakeNews') and a mocking tone, but does not contain profanity, slurs, or language that would be considered offensive under the guideline. Evidence: The phrase '#VeryFakeNews' is derogatory toward CNN but does not rise to the level of hate speech as defined by the guideline.\n\nConclusion: None of the criteria for hate speech are satisfied.",

Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language:\n- Guideline: Does the post contain profanity, slurs, or other offensive language that may or may not be directed at individuals or groups?\n- Evaluation: Satisfied. The phrase '#RemoveTheJews' is highly offensive and constitutes a slur against Jews. The post also uses 'normies' in a derogatory way, though this is less severe than the antisemitic content.\n- Text evidence: '#RemoveTheJews', 'normies'\n\nConclusion: The post contains hate speech as it degrades a protected group (Jews), uses offensive language, and contains a hashtag that can be interpreted as a call for exclusion or violence.",

Assaults on Human Dignity: This criterion checks if the post demeans or degrades individuals or groups based on protected characteristics such as religion, culture, or tradition. The post uses dismissive and disrespectful language towards religious and cultural practices ('I couldn’t give a F*CK what your ‘God’ says', 'I didn’t care if it’s your ‘culture’', 'I don’t care if it’s ‘tradition’'). This language devalues religious and cultural beliefs, potentially assaulting the dignity of those who practice religious slaughter. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. \n\n2. Calls for Violence: This criterion checks for incitement or encouragement of physical harm or violence. The post does not explicitly or implicitly call for violence against any individuals or groups. No evidence of this criterion being satisfied. \n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: This criterion checks for profanity, slurs, or other offensive language. The post contains the phrase 'I couldn’t give a F*CK', which is explicit profanity. This criterion is satisfied.",

Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: No mention of race, gender, etc.\n\n2. Calls for Violence: Checking for incitement or encouragement of physical harm or violence. The post imagines releasing a lion on Congress, with phrases like 'stop feeding her a week or two beforehand', 'lock the doors and enjoy the screaming', and 'I'd probably sell my house to be able to hear it in person.' This is a clear hypothetical scenario that fantasizes about violence (a hungry lion attacking people in Congress). Therefore, this criterion IS satisfied. Evidence: 'turn this magnificent beast loose on Congress', 'stop feeding her', 'lock the doors and enjoy the screaming'.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: Checking for profanity, slurs, or other offensive language. The post uses 'damn', which is mild profanity, but not a slur or highly offensive. Therefore, this criterion is PARTIALLY satisfied (mild profanity present, but not central to hate speech determination). Evidence: 'damn shame'.",

Calls for Violence: This criterion checks for incitement or encouragement of physical harm or violence. The post does not explicitly or implicitly call for violence against any individual or group. The phrase 'if you can just hate enough' references the emotion of hate but does not advocate for violent action. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: No direct or indirect call for violence.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: This criterion checks for profanity, slurs, or offensive language. The post uses the word 'hate', which is a strong negative emotion, but it is not a slur, profanity, or inherently offensive in this context. The rest of the language is abstract and not vulgar. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: No profanity, slurs, or offensive language present.",
