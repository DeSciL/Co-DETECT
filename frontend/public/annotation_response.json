The phrase '#NotMyPope' is a statement of disassociation, not an attack on dignity. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. 2.

There is no language in the post that calls for or encourages violence against any individual or group. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. 3.

We too face unforeseen challenges with the rise of natural tech monopolies.

Calls for Violence: Checking for incitement or encouragement of physical harm or violence. The post states, 'Police departments that tried to resist would become insurrectionists.'

Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: Checking for profanity, slurs, or other offensive language. The term 'wiseass' is used, which is mildly vulgar but not a slur or highly offensive. It is not directed at a protected group, but rather at 'local jurisdiction' in a general, non-specific way. No other offensive language is present. Mild vulgarity is present, but not at a level that meets the threshold for hate speech per the guideline. Not satisfied.",

The post references 'illegal immigrant murderers' and contrasts this with 'mamas and babies.' The phrase '#IllegalImmigrantMurderers' could be interpreted as associating illegal immigrants with murderers, which may be seen as demeaning toward the group 'illegal immigrants.' However, the post does not use explicit slurs or directly demean all immigrants, but rather references a specific subset (those who commit murder).

The post does not contain any language that calls for, incites, or encourages violence against any individual or group. There is no evidence of this in the text.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: This criterion checks for profanity, slurs, or other offensive language. The only potentially offensive word is 'damnedest,' which is mild and not directed at any group or individual in a hateful way.

This is borderline, but since it does not explicitly call for violence, this criterion is NOT strictly satisfied. Evidence: 'die off' is a wish, not a call to action.\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: Checking for profanity, slurs, or offensive language. The phrase 'Good riddance!' is dismissive and hostile, but not profane or a slur. No explicit vulgarity or offensive language is present. This criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: No profanity or slurs.",

Calls for Violence: The post does not directly incite or encourage violence, but it references the taking of 'lives and limbs,' which is a violent act. However, it is framed as a rhetorical question, possibly implying accusation rather than a direct call for violence. This criterion is not clearly satisfied. \n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The post does not contain profanity, but the use of 'goy' in this context is offensive and derogatory. The phrase as a whole is offensive towards a group based on religion/ethnicity.",

The post uses the term 'Commies' (a derogatory term for communists, which is a political ideology, not a protected characteristic), but more notably refers to 'primitive child sodomites' and 'death cult of Satan.' The phrase 'primitive child sodomites' is highly demeaning and dehumanizing, likely targeting a group with a slur that could be interpreted as referring to LGBTQ+ individuals or as a general slur. The phrase 'death cult of Satan' is also demeaning and could be interpreted as targeting a religious group or as a general insult. Both satisfy the criterion for assaults on human dignity.\n\n2. Calls for Violence: Checking for incitement or encouragement of physical harm. The post says, 'Send those primitive child sodomites to Hell if they don't leave on their own.' While 'send to Hell' could be interpreted metaphorically, in this context, it is paired with 'if they don't leave on their own,' which suggests a threat or encouragement of forceful removal, potentially implying violence. This satisfies the criterion for calls for violence.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: Checking for profanity, slurs, or offensive language. The post uses 'child sodomites' (a highly offensive and vulgar slur), 'primitive,' and 'death cult of Satan,' all of which are offensive and demeaning.

The term 'Nazi' is highly offensive and is often used as a slur or to reference hate groups, even if not directed at a specific person or group here. The phrase 'Supa Nazi' could be interpreted as referencing or promoting Nazi-related content, which is inherently offensive. The context ('mirror Supa Nazi on my Pewtube') suggests sharing or promoting content with a Nazi reference, which may be considered offensive or as indirectly promoting hate speech.",

'Normies' is a slang term for mainstream people, but it is not a protected characteristic and is not used here in a demeaning way. Not satisfied.\n\n2. Calls for Violence: The guideline asks if the post incites or encourages physical harm or violence against individuals or groups. There is no language in the post that calls for, incites, or encourages violence. Not satisfied.\n\n3.

Not satisfied.\n\nText evidence: The post is focused on writing and reading novels, and the use of 'red pill' and 'normies' is not accompanied by hate speech or offensive language.",

However, the post itself does not explicitly attack or degrade any group. Guideline component: Not clearly satisfied, but contextually suggestive. Evidence: 'war propaganda for the white genocide.'\n\n2. Calls for Violence: Checking if the post incites or encourages physical harm or violence. There is no explicit or implicit call for violence in the post. Guideline component: Not satisfied. Evidence: No language inciting violence.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: Checking for profanity, slurs, or offensive language. The post does not contain profanity or slurs. The term 'white genocide' is offensive in some contexts due to its association with hate speech, but in this post, it is used as part of a conspiracy theory claim rather than as a direct slur. Guideline component: Partially suggestive, but not explicit. Evidence: 'white genocide.'",

Not satisfied. Evidence: 'media tycoons are in cahoots with governments, banks and big corporations.'\n\n2. Calls for Violence: The guideline asks if the post incites or encourages physical harm or violence against individuals or groups. There is no call for violence, incitement, or encouragement of harm in the post. Not satisfied. Evidence: The post is critical but does not advocate violence.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The guideline asks if the post contains profanity, slurs, or other offensive language that may or may not be directed at individuals or groups. The language is critical and accusatory but does not contain profanity, slurs, or offensive language. Not satisfied. Evidence: Phrases like 'in cahoots' and 'covering up the sins' are not vulgar or slurs.\n\nConclusion: None of the hate speech criteria are satisfied.",

Evidence: 'The thing about Globalists is not only do they fight dirty...' and 'Only the elite get to stay out of the way when they play war.'\n\n2. Calls for Violence: Checking if the post incites or encourages physical harm or violence against individuals or groups. The post does not call for, incite, or encourage violence. It describes 'Globalists' as fighting dirty and playing war, but does not encourage violence against them or others. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: No language inciting violence is present.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: Checking for profanity, slurs, or other offensive language. The post uses the phrase 'fight dirty,' which is negative but not profane or a slur. No vulgar or offensive language is present. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: No profanity or slurs in the text.",

The comparison to the KKK and the assertion that 'single, black, women cannot raise st...' is offensive and demeaning.\n\nSummary: The post satisfies the 'Assaults on Human Dignity' criterion and contains offensive language directed at protected groups.",

This satisfies the 'demean or degrade' criterion, with evidence: 'libtards and socialists (also known as libtards)'.\n\n2. Calls for Violence: The post states, 'me and 63,000,000 of my closest friends will be in your face BIGGLY. And we know what to do because I am Jungle Warfare qualified and I did bring home 3 Bronze Stars from the Nam....AND I have never forgotten my oath.' While this language is aggressive and implies a threat, it does not explicitly incite or encourage physical harm or violence. The phrase 'we know what to do' is vague and could be interpreted as a threat, but it does not directly call for violence. Therefore, this criterion is not clearly satisfied.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The term 'libtard' is offensive and considered a slur. The rest of the post does not contain additional profanity, but the use of 'libtard' alone satisfies this criterion. Evidence: 'libtards'.",
