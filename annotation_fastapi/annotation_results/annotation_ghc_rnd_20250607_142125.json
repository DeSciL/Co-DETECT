However, these statements express personal opinion and disagreement with the church, but do not contain demeaning or degrading language toward Catholics as a group.

This satisfies the criterion for offensive language, even if not directly addressed to an individual but rather referencing a demeaning depiction.",

Wilson was one of the worst presidents (3rd after FDR and Lincoln) but was an imaginative political thinker. Despite the pretensions of our ideological, Enlightenment-influenced Founders, it can hardly be denied that their writings and documents didn’t address the labor problems and unchecked influence of a few big businesses which arose in the later 19th century, even if Wilson’s solutions were wrong. We too face unforeseen challenges with the rise of natural tech monopolies. New challenges call for new solutions, whether or not they were envisioned as permissible by founding documents which after all are historical artifacts.",

Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language:\n- Checked: Does the post contain profanity, slurs, or other offensive language that may or may not be directed at individuals or groups?\n- Satisfied: The use of 'Niggerville' is a racial slur and highly offensive language.\n- Evidence: 'Niggerville' is a slur.\n\nConclusion: The post contains hate speech due to the use of a racial slur and demeaning language targeting a group based on race.",

The post does not contain any language that calls for, incites, or encourages violence. It only discusses the potential for harassment (presumably legal or social, not physical) if Gab.ai remains hosted in the USA. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: No language in the post calls for violence.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The guideline asks if the post contains profanity, slurs, or other offensive language, whether or not it is directed at individuals or groups. The post does not contain any profanity, slurs, or offensive language. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: The language is neutral and factual.\n\nConclusion: None of the hate speech criteria are satisfied.",

Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: 'should be branded upon the ass of everyone who runs for office.'\n\n2. Calls for Violence: Checking for incitement or encouragement of physical harm or violence. The phrase 'branded upon the ass' is metaphorical and hyperbolic, commonly used to mean 'should be made very clear to' or 'should be remembered by.'

This language degrades and demeans both Jews and Europeans by making broad, essentialist, and comparative claims about intelligence based on ethnicity and genetics, which is a classic form of group-based dehumanization and stereotyping. \n\n2. Calls for Violence: This criterion is not satisfied. There is no explicit or implicit incitement or encouragement of physical harm or violence against any group or individual in the text. \n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: This criterion is partially satisfied. While there is no profanity or slurs, the language is offensive in its use of racial and ethnic essentialism and in making comparative claims about intelligence between groups, which is considered offensive and demeaning even without explicit vulgarity.",

However, the post itself does not make any demeaning or degrading statements about any protected group.

The post is a recounting of an online argument and does not advocate for harm.\n- Satisfied: NOT SATISFIED\n- Evidence: No calls for violence present in the text.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language:\n- Guideline: Does the post contain profanity, slurs, or other offensive language that may or may not be directed at individuals or groups?\n- Evaluation: The post uses the phrase 'big-fat counter-intelligence disinformation bomb,' which is hyperbolic but not profane or a slur. The rest of the language is not vulgar or offensive. No slurs or profanity are present.\n- Satisfied: NOT SATISFIED\n- Evidence: No profanity or slurs detected; 'big-fat' is not offensive in this context.\n\nConclusion: None of the hate speech criteria are satisfied.",

Evidence: The post only discusses memes and Poe's Law, with no mention of violence.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The guideline asks if the post contains profanity, slurs, or other offensive language that may or may not be directed at individuals or groups. The post does not contain any profanity, slurs, or overtly offensive language. The phrase 'can't meme' is a mild criticism or stereotype about a political group, but it does not rise to the level of vulgarity or offensive language as defined by the guideline. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: No profanity or slurs present; 'can't meme' is not a slur or vulgarity.",

While 'Soros' is sometimes used as an antisemitic dog whistle, in this context, there is no explicit reference to protected characteristics (e.g., religion, ethnicity) or direct slurs. The insult 'pimple on our ass' is vulgar and demeaning, but it is directed at a political figure, not a protected group. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.\n\n2. Calls for Violence: This criterion checks for incitement or encouragement of physical harm or violence. The post urges people to 'get out to vote Conservative' and 'rid ourselves of this pimple on our ass,' which is a metaphorical insult, not a literal call for violence. There is no explicit or implicit call for physical harm. Not satisfied.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: This criterion checks for profanity, slurs, or other offensive language. The phrase 'pimple on our ass' is vulgar and offensive, but it is not a slur and is directed at a political figure (Trudeau), not a protected group. The rest of the language is inflammatory but not profane or slur-based. This criterion is partially satisfied (vulgarity present), but the offensive language is not directed at a protected group.\n\nSummary: The post contains vulgar and demeaning language directed at a political figure, but does not meet the threshold for hate speech as defined by the guidelines (no attack on protected characteristics, no call for violence, no slurs).",

This degrades and dehumanizes both the supposed 'commies' and the groups they are accused of replacing, and invokes a narrative that is often used in hate speech against non-white, non-Christian populations.\n- Evidence: 'dirty stinking commies', 'Get rid of the White Christian people of the west', 'replacement population'.\n\n2. Calls for Violence:\n- Guideline: Does the post incite or encourage physical harm or violence against individuals or groups?\n- Evaluation: Not directly satisfied. The post does not explicitly call for violence, but it does use language ('get rid of') that could be interpreted as a call for removal or harm, though it is framed as an accusation against others rather than a direct incitement.\n- Evidence: 'Get rid of the White Christian people of the west' (framed as an accusation, not a direct call to action).\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language:\n- Guideline: Does the post contain profanity, slurs, or other offensive language that may or may not be directed at individuals or groups?\n- Evaluation: Satisfied. The phrase 'dirty stinking commies' is a slur/offensive language directed at a group. The overall tone is derogatory and inflammatory.\n- Evidence: 'dirty stinking commies'.\n\nConclusion: The post contains hate speech as it degrades groups based on political and implied ethnic/religious characteristics, uses offensive language, and invokes a white replacement conspiracy trope.",

Calls for Violence: This criterion checks for incitement or encouragement of physical harm or violence. The post expresses a wish for Hillary Clinton to be imprisoned, but does not call for violence or physical harm against her or any group. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: No language inciting violence is present.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: This criterion checks for profanity, slurs, or other offensive language. The post uses the phrase 'witch-hunt' (in quotes, referencing Trump's language) and 'eating off a tin plate' (a reference to prison), but does not use profanity or slurs. The language is critical and disparaging toward Hillary Clinton, but not vulgar or profane. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: No profanity or slurs are present; 'witch' is used in a political context, not as a slur.",

This language degrades 'liberals' by calling their thinking 'stupid and wrong' and equating their beliefs to 'mental illness.'

Calls for Violence: Checking if the post incites or encourages physical harm or violence against individuals or groups. There is no language in the post that calls for or encourages violence. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: No mention of harm or violence.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: Checking if the post contains profanity, slurs, or other offensive language. The term 'Crapweasel' is a vulgar insult, but it is not a slur or profanity, nor is it directed at a protected group. It is a general insult, possibly aimed at politicians or the Senate, but not hate speech per the guideline. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: 'Crapweasel' is an insult, but not a slur or hate term as defined.",

Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: This criterion checks for profanity, slurs, or other offensive language. The post does not contain profanity or slurs. The phrase 'Allahu Akbar!' is not inherently offensive; it is a religious phrase. Its use in the context of an attack could be seen as potentially inflammatory, but the post itself does not use vulgar or offensive language. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.",

Calls for Violence:\n- Checking for incitement or encouragement of physical harm or violence.\n- Evidence: No explicit or implicit calls for violence are present in the text.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language:\n- Checking for profanity, slurs, or other offensive language.\n- Evidence: The post contains 'I don't give a 💩 about you,' which is a vulgar expression. The terms 'Holly Weird,' 'hypocritical criminal Demon Craps' are derogatory and offensive, especially 'Demon Craps' as a slur against a political group (Democrats). While not a protected characteristic, it is still offensive language.\n\nSummary: The post contains demeaning language towards a 'fat girl' (body shaming and gender), vulgarity, and derogatory language towards public figures and a political group.",

Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. \n\n2. Calls for Violence: Checking if the post incites or encourages physical harm or violence against individuals or groups. There is no language in the post that calls for, incites, or encourages violence. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. \n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: Checking for profanity, slurs, or other offensive language. The post uses the word 'demon' as an adjective ('demon globalist and MSM'), which is derogatory but not a slur or profanity. The term 'demonized' is used in a passive sense ('most demonized and hated broadcast'), which is not offensive language directed at a group. No explicit slurs or profanity are present. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied.",
