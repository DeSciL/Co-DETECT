However, the insult is directed at her as an individual and political figure, not based on any protected characteristic. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: 'Crooked Hillary' is a pejorative nickname, but not based on protected characteristics.\n\n2. Calls for Violence: The post does not incite or encourage physical harm or violence against any individual or group. It references 'due process,' which is a legal principle, and does not contain any language suggesting violence. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: 'deserves “due process”' is a call for legal procedure, not violence.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The post uses the term 'Crooked Hillary,' which is a derogatory nickname, but it does not contain profanity, slurs, or offensive language targeting protected groups. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: 'Crooked' is an insult, but not a slur or profanity, and not directed at a protected group.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Edge Case 1 applies: The post targets a public figure (Hillary Clinton) without explicit calls for violence or slurs targeting protected groups. Therefore, classify as 0 (no hate speech).",

The post discusses unions, union members, and employees, but these are not protected characteristics under the guideline. The only potentially demeaning language is 'people who couldn't do anything else except walk around with a sign,' which targets union picketers, not a protected group. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. 2. Calls for Violence: The post does not incite or encourage physical harm or violence against any individuals or groups. There are no threats or calls for violence. This criterion is NOT satisfied. 3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The post uses the phrase 'pissed off' and refers to picketers as 'people who couldn't do anything else except walk around with a sign.' While this is dismissive and potentially offensive to union picketers, it does not use profanity, slurs, or offensive language targeting protected groups. This criterion is NOT satisfied. 4.

The phrase 'normie race redpilled, but JQ igno Goys' suggests a demeaning or mocking attitude toward individuals who are not aware of or do not subscribe to antisemitic conspiracy theories. The laughter ('make me lafff... und laff.. und laff...') further indicates ridicule. This satisfies the criterion for demeaning or degrading individuals or groups based on protected characteristics (ethnicity/religion).\n\n2. Calls for Violence: There is no explicit incitement or encouragement of physical harm or violence in the post. Not satisfied. No text evidence of calls for violence.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The post uses coded language ('JQ', 'Goys') that is commonly associated with hate speech, particularly in antisemitic contexts. While not overtly profane, the use of these terms in this context is offensive and derogatory toward protected groups. Satisfied.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Edge case 6: The post uses ambiguous/coded references ('JQ', 'Goys'), but in this case, the context and combination of terms ('race', 'redpilled', 'JQ', 'Goys') and the mocking tone provide sufficient evidence of demeaning language targeting protected groups. Therefore, this is not merely ambiguous/coded language without context; it is explicit enough to satisfy the hate speech criteria.\n- Edge case 7: The post dehumanizes or trivializes protected groups (Jewish people and non-Jews) through mocking and coded hate speech. Satisfied.",

Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The post does not contain profanity or slurs, but the use of quotation marks around 'Palestinians' and 'refugees' is a form of delegitimization, and the phrase 'weapon of the jihad' is offensive and dehumanizing. This satisfies the guideline for offensive language directed at a protected group. \n\nEdge Case Handling: The post dehumanizes a protected group (Palestinians, based on ethnicity/national origin and religion) by invalidating their identity and associating them with violence in a dehumanizing way. This matches edge case 7: 'when a post dehumanizes protected groups by invalidating identities or trivializing atrocities through symbolism/narratives -> classify as hate speech (1)'.",

The phrase 'replace us' is ambiguous and could be a coded reference, but without explicit context or demeaning language, it does not meet the threshold for hate speech.",

Calls for Violence: The post does not incite or encourage physical harm or violence against any individual or group. The phrase 'kicking a dog when it’s down' is a metaphor for piling on or attacking someone who is already vulnerable, but it is not a literal call for violence. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: 'kicking a dog when it’s down' (metaphorical usage).\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The post contains offensive language ('trash', 'scum'), but it is directed at a political group, not a protected group. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied for hate speech as defined. Evidence: 'liberal far left trash', 'scum'.\n4. Edge Case Handling: Rule 1 applies: 'when the post targets non-protected groups, individuals, or characteristics (e.g., political groups, institutions, public figures) without explicit calls for violence or slurs targeting protected groups -> classify as 0 (no hate speech)'. The post targets a political group with offensive language but does not target a protected group or incite violence.",

Evidence: No offensive language present.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Edge Case 3: 'when the post contains references to violence, threats, or aggressive language without inciting harm against protected groups or using explicit hate speech elements -> classify as 0 (no hate speech)'. The post references 'civil war' (a violent event) but does not incite harm or use hate speech elements. This edge case applies.\n- Edge Case 5: If content lacks sufficient information for evaluation (e.g., URLs, non-text media, ambiguous language, or insufficient context) -> refuse to classify (-1). The post is somewhat ambiguous, as it may refer to external content ('best view this'), but the text itself is what is being annotated, and per the guideline, we do not annotate based on implied or missing content unless the text itself is insufficient. Here, the text is ambiguous but not entirely unclassifiable.\n- Edge Case 9: When content lacks explicit evidence of demeaning language, calls for violence, or offensive slurs targeting protected characteristics, despite potential ambiguity, sarcasm, indirect references, or coded language -> classify as 0 (no hate speech) with low confidence due to ambiguity. This edge case also applies, as the post is ambiguous and indirect, but lacks explicit hate speech elements.",

The post uses strong negative language ('abomination,' 'travesty,' 'criminals'), but these are not slurs or profanities, nor are they directed at protected groups. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. Evidence: 'abomination,' 'criminals.'\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Edge Case 1: The post targets public figures (Obama & Clinton) and alleged conspirators, not protected groups, and does not use slurs or call for violence. According to Edge Case 1, this should be classified as 0 (no hate speech).\n- Edge Case 3: References to 'crime' and 'criminals' are aggressive but not inciting harm against protected groups or using explicit hate speech elements.\n- No ambiguity or coded language is present that would require flagging or low confidence.",

Not satisfied. Evidence: No violent or inciting language present.\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The guideline asks if the post contains profanity, slurs, or other offensive language. 'F-' is ambiguous; it could be interpreted as the beginning of a profanity (e.g., 'fuck'), but as written, it is incomplete and does not constitute an explicit slur or offensive word. Not satisfied. Evidence: The text is incomplete and does not contain a full offensive word.\n4. Edge Case Handling: Rule 5 applies: when content lacks sufficient information for evaluation (e.g., ambiguous language, insufficient context), refuse to classify (-1). 'F-' is ambiguous and lacks context, making it impossible to determine intent or target.",

This matches edge case 1: 'when the post targets non-protected groups, individuals, or characteristics (e.g., political groups, institutions, public figures) without explicit calls for violence or slurs targeting protected groups -> classify as 0 (no hate speech)'. The post also references violence ('threatening families'), but only to condemn it, matching edge case 3. No ambiguity or insufficient information is present.",

The post calls the adults involved 'perverts' and refuses to call them 'parents', implying they are unfit or immoral. The phrase 'who do this 'thing' to them' and 'knowingly encourage sexualising their young minds' frames the adults as predatory and abusive, which is a demeaning and degrading characterization.

The phrase 'ENRICHMENT LEVELS BREAK THE SCALE' is a coded reference frequently used in far-right/anti-immigrant discourse, where 'enrichment' sarcastically refers to demographic or cultural changes due to immigration, often with negative connotations. The post does not explicitly name a protected group, but the context and language strongly suggest a demeaning reference to immigrants or ethnic minorities in London. This satisfies the guideline for dehumanization and assaults on human dignity (see edge case 7: 'when a post dehumanizes protected groups by invalidating identities or trivializing atrocities through symbolism/narratives -> classify as hate speech (1)').\n\n2. Calls for Violence: There is no explicit call for violence or encouragement of physical harm in the post. Not satisfied. Text evidence: 'I HOPE THE ENRICHMENT LEVELS BREAK THE SCALE' is a wish for increased demographic change, not a call for violence.\n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: There is no profanity or explicit slur, but the use of 'infected' as a metaphor for a city (implying the presence of undesirable people) is offensive and dehumanizing. Satisfied in the sense of offensive metaphorical language targeting a protected group.\n\nEdge Case Handling: The post uses coded language and metaphor to dehumanize a protected group (likely immigrants or ethnic minorities in London), which is covered by edge case 7. The language is not ambiguous in its intent given the context and common usage of these terms in hate speech.\n\nConclusion: The post contains hate speech due to dehumanizing metaphor and coded language targeting protected groups.",

However, the phrase is used as a descriptor and not in an explicitly demeaning, degrading, or slurring manner. There is no further context in the excerpt to indicate that the judge is being insulted or dehumanized for being Jewish. Therefore, this criterion is NOT satisfied. \n\n2. Calls for Violence: The post does not incite or encourage physical harm or violence against any individual or group. It discusses concerns about legal processes and potential abuses but does not call for violence. This criterion is NOT satisfied. \n\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The post does not contain profanity, slurs, or other offensive language. The use of 'Jew judge' is a reference to religion/ethnicity but is not, in this context, an explicit slur or vulgarity. This criterion is NOT satisfied. \n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Edge Case 2: The post references a protected group ('Jew judge') but lacks explicit assaults on dignity, calls for violence, or vulgarity/offensive language directed at them. According to the guideline, this should be classified as 0 (no hate speech).\n- Edge Case 6: The reference to 'Jew judge' could be considered ambiguous/coded, but there is no explicit demeaning language, calls for violence, or clarifying context. The guideline says to classify as 0 (no hate speech) but flag for review.\n\nNo other edge case applies. The post does not contain sufficient evidence of hate speech as defined by the guidelines.",

Most of them look like the white people they claim to hate.' does not explicitly demean, degrade, or use slurs against these groups.

Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The post uses the word 'bullshit' twice, which is profanity, but it is not directed at a protected group or used as a slur. The profanity is used to express disbelief or frustration, not as a targeted insult.

It is not ambiguous or lacking context, so edge cases 5 and 6 do not apply. The demeaning generalization about protected characteristics (race) and the implication that 'white liberals' are uniquely 'tricked' satisfies the hate speech criteria.",

This frames Israel (a nation-state, but also often a proxy for Jewish people as a protected group) as an existential threat to all of humanity, which is a demeaning and dehumanizing narrative. This satisfies the guideline for demeaning or degrading a protected group through symbolic/narrative means (see edge case 7). Evidence: 'either humanity will exist or Israel will exist. Not both.'\n2. Calls for Violence: The post does not explicitly call for violence or encourage physical harm. Not satisfied. Evidence: No direct incitement or encouragement of violence in the text.\n3. Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: The post does not contain profanity, slurs, or explicit offensive language.

The post uses a narrative that dehumanizes or delegitimizes a protected group (Israel/Jews) by framing their existence as incompatible with humanity.",
