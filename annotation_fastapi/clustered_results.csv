However, none of these terms directly target a protected characteristic such as race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. The terms are political insults, not hate speech per the guideline's definition. Not satisfied. Evidence: 'Globalist. RINO. Traitor.'\n2. Calls for Violence: There is no language in the post that incites or encourages physical harm or violence against any individual or group. Not satisfied. Evidence: No calls for violence present.\n3.
